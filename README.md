The snapshot shown represents Karnataka state, and all visuals dynamically update when the state or quarter selection is changed.

### 2.PROBLEM STATEMENT 
E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data across multiple states, products, and time periods, making it challenging to track performance, identify profitable segments, and understand customer behavior at a regional level. The lack of an interactive and centralized reporting system limits the ability to analyze key metrics such as revenue, profit, sales volume, payment preferences, and seasonal trends for a selected state.To address this issue,create an interactive dashboard that consolidates all these metrics in a single view.
